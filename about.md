# Menu Loop Start Time

This mod allows you to set a custom start point for your menu song, or randomly choose from multiple!

Useful if you want to skip the intro of a song, or start at multiple different points in it.

<cy>Important notes:</c>
- Everything in this mod is configured via the mod settings menu
- This mod simply skips the song ahead to a certain point, it will still loop back to 0:00
- If you change your menu loop, you will need to update all your settings
- Geode has built-in setting profiles, feel free to save one for each menu song you use
- You probably don't want to use this mod if you have a randomized menu song
